The `<Stackable/>` can be used to render elements that need to visually appear as if they are "stacked"
one of top of the other. This is done through the usage of portals and the Context API.

### Motivation

Certain UI elements like dialogs, popovers and menus need to appear on top of their containing element.
This is usually done with absolute positioning and z-indexing. However, `z-index`s are relative to the parent's [stacking
context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context),
so it is possible for a lower z-index to appear above a higher z-index, if the former has a higher stacking context.

#### The Component To End All `z-index` Issues

To solve the above issue, we use portals. Using portals we can send the elements to the body, thus resetting their stacking context.
However, when we use portals, not only do we reset the stacking context, but we also completely flatten the DOM tree.

This is where `<Stackable/>` comes in: It allows us to reset the stacking context while maintaining
the stacking context between the *portal'ed* elements.

This is done by communicating the depth between `<Stackable/>` elements through context, and incrementing
their z-index based on their nesting depth in the React component tree, rather than the actual DOM tree.

## Stacking

<Example file='docs/components/stackable/Stacking' height={400}/>

You can stack *Stackables* by nesting them.
A nested `<Stackable/>` receives a higher `z-index` than its parent.
The lowest z-index is defined by the `zIndex` prop, which is set to `10` by default.

```jsx
<Stackable zIndex={5}> <-- Receives a z-index of 5
    <Stackable/> <-- Receives a z-index of 6
</Stackable>
```

## Event Propagation

<Example file='docs/components/stackable/EventPropagation' height={400}/>

In React, events are propagated based on the React tree, and not the DOM tree.
This means that events are propagated through portals (see [Event Bubbling Through Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html#event-bubbling-through-portals)).

We leverage this fact in this example to show how click events are propagated through nested
`Stackable` components, despite the fact that they are siblings in the DOM.

## Ancestors

<Example file='docs/components/stackable/Ancestors' height={400}/>

In this example, clicking on a `<Stackable/>` will show the list of classes of all of its ancestors
starting from the furthest to the closest ancestor. This list is accessible via the `Stackable.getAncestors()`
function, or via the `data-ancestors` attribute on the `<Stackable/>` DOM element.

For the list to be accurately populated, you must pass a `ReactRef` to the parent element as the
`parent` prop.

> Notice that the list of ancestors is displayed
> according to the React component tree, and not the DOM tree.

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Stackable} from 'webrix/components';
import Stackable from 'webrix/components/Stackable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Stackable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Functions

*Stackable.getAncestors()*

The `getAncestors()` function takes a DOM element as an argument, and returns a `string` representing the path
of to that element based on the React Component tree.

*Syntax*

`path = Stackable.getAncestors(element)`

*Parameters*

`element` - A DOM element representing a `<Stackable/>`.

*Return Value*

A string with the of classnames of all the ancestors of the given `<Stackable/>`,
up to, but not including, the `<body/>` element.


### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`zIndex`|number|`10`|Specifies the `z-index` for the given `Stackable`. Nested `Stackables` will receive a `z-index` that is 1 higher than this.
`target`|Element|`document.body`|Specifies portal target.
`parent`|React Ref|`{}`|Specifies a reference to the parent component. This optional, and is only used for generating the `data-ancestors` attribute.
`children`|Node|`null`|Specifies the children of the component.

 > NOTE: Any prop other than the props listed above will be injected to the `div` element of the `<Stackable/>`.
