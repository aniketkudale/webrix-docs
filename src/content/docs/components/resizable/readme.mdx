import {Example} from 'components';

The `<Resizable/>` component can be used to create elements that can be resized by the user.
A `<Resizable/>` element receives up to 8 resizers, that can be used to resize the element in
all directions - horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/BasicExample' height={300}/>

In this example you can see a fully resizable element.

The `onResize` prop can be used to listen to resize changes.
It passes an object with `width`, `height`, `top` and `left` keys to the handler.
These corresponding values represent the change (delta) in dimensions/position, rather than
the actual new dimensions/position.

To get the actual dimensions/position, simply add the deltas to the initial values.

## Min/Max Sizes

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/MinMaxSizes' height={350}/>

The `<Resizable/>` component gives you complete control over the resizing of the element by only passing information
through the event without actually manipulating the element itself.
This way you are free to add your own logic and constraints.

In this example the element has min/max width/height, that we apply by simply using `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`
together to keep the value within a certain range.

> Note that the same can be achieved using CSS `max-width`/`max-height`/`min-width`/`min-height`, as long as
> only the bottom/right resizers are being used. The above CSS cannot work for top/left resizers, since the
> top/left positioning should be limited as well, and that can only be achieved programmatically.

## Snapping

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/Snapping' height={300}/>

Similarly to the previous example, more complex constraints can be applied, like snapping.
This can be achieved by applying the following formula to the coordinates of the element:

```jsx
const GRID_SIZE = 20;
Math.round(x / GRID_SIZE) * GRID_SIZE;
```

Note that we're using the `delta` here instead of the `change`. The former represents the
delta since the beginning of the resize operation (i.e. mousedown), and the latter
represents the change since the last event (i.e. mousemove).

We're using the `delta` because the resize operation in this example is not smooth,
so if we used the `change` nothing would happen because the increments would be too
small and they would always be rounded down.

Applying this on the `delta` causes the resizable element to be resized in steps of `GRID_SIZE`, as can
be seen above.

> `Math.round()` rounds number up, so rounding `1.5` gives `2`, while
> rounding `-1.5` gives `1`. This can cause small glitches when snap-resizing.
> To avoid that we remove the sign before rounding, and then insert it back,
> making the rounding consistent regardless of the sign.
> See the source code for more info.

## Custom Directions

<Example file='docs/components/resizable/CustomDirections' height={300}/>

Instead of using `<Resizable.Resizers.All/>`, you can use any combination of resizers to limit
the resize operation to certain directions. In this example we use `Right`,`Bottom` and `BottomRight`
resizers to allow the element to be resized only at those edges/coreners.

## API

### Importing

```jsx
// ESM
import {Resizable} from 'webrix/components';
import Resizable from 'webrix/components/Resizable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Resizable} = Webrix.components;
```

### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`children`|node|`null`|Specifies resizers to use. One of `Resizable.Resizers` (see below).
`onBeginResize`|func|`() => null`|Specifies an event handler to be called when the user begins to resize the element.
`onResize`|func|`() => null`|Specifies an event handler to be continuously called as the user resizes the element. Receives an object with `top`/`left`/`width`/`height`, representing the deltas.
`onEndResize`|func|`() => null`|Specifies an event handler to be called when the user stops resizing the element.

### Resizers

* `<Resizable.Resizers.All/>` - All horizontal, vertical and diagonal resizers.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.Top/>` - Top vertical resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.Bottom/>` - Bottom vertical resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.Left/>` - Left horizontal resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.Right/>` - Right horizontal resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.TopRight/>` - Top right corner diagonal resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.TopLeft/>` - Top left corner diagonal resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.BottomRight/>` - Bottom right corner diagonal resizer.
* `<Resizable.Resizers.BottomLeft/>` - Bottom left corner diagonal resizer.
