The `<Movable/>` component can be used to create items that can be moved around. As opposed to a draggable element,
the `<Movable/>` component does not require a source/target configuration. All it does is trigger an event when the user
moves it around, passing the mouse position (`x/y`), the difference in the coordinates since the beginning of the event
(`dx/dy`), and the difference in the coordinates since the last event (`cx/cy`)

## Basic Example

<Example file='docs/components/movable/BasicExample' height={200}/>

In this example you can see how, using the `onMove`, we can change the element coordinates based on `cx/cy`.

Notice that we are using a function to set the state, instead of passing an object directly.
This is because the [state may be updated asynchronously](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous),
so we cannot rely on the state value for calculating the next position.

Using a function will give us the previous state as an argument, and we can use that to accurately calculate the
next position.

## Constraint Movement

<Example file='docs/components/movable/ConstraintMovement' height={200}/>

The `<Movable/>` component gives you complete control over the positioning of the element by only passing information
through the event without actually manipulating the element itself.
This way you are free to add your own logic and constraints.

In this example, we ignore the movement of the mouse on the `x` axis to constraint the element to the `y`
axis.

## Snapping

<Example file='docs/components/movable/Snapping' height={200}/>

Similarly to the previous example, more complex constraints can be applied, like snapping.
This can be achieved by applying the following formula to the coordinates of the element:

```jsx
const GRID_SIZE = 20;
Math.round(x / GRID_SIZE) * GRID_SIZE;
```

The main difference is that we are no longer updating the state for every event (the user can move
the mouse without the object moving with it until it snaps to the next grid line).
Because of that, we need to maintain the initial position of the element, and use `dx/dy`
instead to get the next position.

### Importing

```jsx

import Movable from 'webrix/components/Movable'; // For better tree shaking

// UMD
const {Movable} = Webrix.components;
```
### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`onBeginMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be called when the user begins to move the element
`onMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be continuously called as the user moves the element around. Receives `x/y/dx/dy/cx/cy` as arguments (see description above for more info)
`onEndMove`|function|`() => null`|Specifies a callback to be called when the user stops moving the element
