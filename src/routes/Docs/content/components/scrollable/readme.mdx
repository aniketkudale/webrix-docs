import {Example} from 'components';

The `<Scrollable/>` component can be used to apply custom scrollbar styling to a scrollable element.
It does so by hiding the native scrollbars, and displaying real DOM elements instead.
The positioning of the scrollbars is determined by the `scrollTop` property on the container.

It's important to note that the `<Scrollable/>` component behaves just like any other div would,
so in terms of CSS everything else should work as it would have if you were using the native

## Vertical Scroll

<Example file='components/scrollable/VerticalScroll' height={400}/>

In this example you can see the behaviour of a vertical scrollbar

## Horizontal Scroll

<Example file='components/scrollable/HorizontalScroll' height={400}/>

In this example you can see the behaviour of a horizontal scrollbar

## Minimal Thumb Size

<Example file='components/scrollable/MinimalThumbSize' height={400}/>

The thumb size is affected by the content's length - the longer the content is, the smaller
the thumb is - down to a minimum size of `MIN_THUMB_SIZE` of the container's size.

## Resize Detection

<Example file='components/scrollable/ResizeDetection' height={400}/>

In this example you can see how the scrollbar is getting adjusted to the container in case of resize

## Scrollbar Shadow

<Example file='components/scrollable/ScrollbarShadow' height={400}/>

By adding `Scrollable.Shadow` you can define a shadow that appears once the scrollbar is getting to the top or the bottom of the container.

## Custom Scrollbars

<Example file='components/scrollable/CustomScrollbars' height={400}/>

If you want to have some custom scrollbars, you can do so by providing your own scrollbar component.
This can be done by passing `<Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>` and/or `<Scrollbar.HorizontalScrollbar>`
as children, and passing your custom scrollbar as a child to them.
In this example you can see a custom vertical scrollbar, positioned outside of the container.

```jsx
<Scrollbar>
    {...}
    <Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>
        <MyCustomScrollbar/>
    </Scrollbar.VerticalScrollbar>
</Scrollbar>
```

### Importing

```jsx
import {Scrollable} from 'webrix';
import Scrollable from 'webrix/Zoomable'; // For better tree shaking
```
### Props
Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`children`|node|`null`|Specifies the scrollable content.
`element`|node|`<div/>`|Specifies the scrollable element.
`style`|object|`{}`|Specifies a style object to be used for styling the scrollbar. NOTE: This should only be used for values that are computed in runtime using JavaScript. Static values should be applied using CSS.
`scrollOnDOMChange`|boolean|`true`|Specifies whether the scroll position should update when there's a change in the internal DOM structure. When set to `true`, adding an element above the visible area will update the scroll position so that the previously visible area is still visible.
`onScroll`|function|`() => null`|Specifies function to be called when a scroll event occurs. Receives an object with the following properties: `top`, `left`, `scrollTop`, `scrollLeft`, `scrollHeight`, `scrollWidth`, `clientWidth`, `clientHeight`,
