import {Example} from 'components';

The `<Zoomable/>` component can be used to to create items that can be zoomed in and zoom out. It receives the number to scale the children up or down.

## Basic Example

<Example file='components/zoomable/BasicExample' height={400}/>

In this example you can see how a zoom of 1 will produce the un-zoomed children and a zoom of 2 will show the children twice as big.

## Zooming Example

<Example file='components/zoomable/Zooming' height={400}/>

In this example you can use the plus and minus buttons in order to see how the children get zoom in and out.
