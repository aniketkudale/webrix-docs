The `<Stackable/>` can be used to render elements that need to visually appear as if they are "stacked"
one of top of the other. This is done through the usage of portals and the Context API.

### Motivation

Certain UI elements like dialogs, popovers and menus need to appear on top of their containing element.
This is usually done with absolute positioning and z-indexing. However, `z-index`s are relative to the parent's [stacking
context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context),
so it is possible for a lower z-index to appear above a higher z-index, if the former has a higher stacking context.

#### The Component To End All `z-index` Issues

To solve the above issue, we use portals. Using portals we can send the elements to the body, thus resetting their stacking context.
However, when we use portals, not only do we reset the stacking context, but we also completely flatten the DOM tree.

This is where `<Stackable/>` comes in: It allows us to reset the stacking context while maintaining
the stacking context between the *portal'ed* elements.

This is done by communicating the depth between `<Stackable/>` elements through context, and incrementing
their z-index based on their nesting depth in the React component tree, rather than the actual DOM tree.

## Stacking

<Example file='components/stackable/Stacking' height={400}/>

You can stack *Stackables* by nesting them.
A nested `<Stackable/>` receives a higher `z-index` than it's parent.
The lowest z-index is a constant specified in `BASE_Z_INDEX`, set to 10.

```jsx
<Stackable> <-- Receives a z-index of BASE_Z_INDEX
    <Stackable/> <-- Receives a z-index of BASE_Z_INDEX + 1
</Stackable>
```

## Event Propagation

<Example file='components/stackable/EventPropagation' height={400}/>

In React, events are propagated based on the React tree, and not the DOM tree.
This means that events are propagated through portals (see [Event Bubbling Through Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html#event-bubbling-through-portals)).

We leverage this fact in this example to show how click events are propagated through nested
`Stackable` components, despite the fact that they are siblings in the DOM.

## Ancestors

<Example file='components/stackable/Ancestors' height={400}/>

In this example, clicking on a `<Stackable/>` will show the list of classes of all of its ancestors
starting from the furthest to the closest ancestor. Notice that the list of ancestors is displayed
according to the React component tree, and not the DOM tree.

## API

### Importing

```jsx
import {Stackable} from 'webrix/components';
import Stackable from 'webrix/components/Stackable'; // For better tree shaking
```

### Functions

*Stackable.getAncestors()*

The `getAncestors()` function takes a DOM element as an argument, and returns a `string` representing the path
of to that element based on the React Component tree.

*Syntax*

`path = Stackable.getAncestors(element)`

*Parameters*

`element` - A DOM element representing a `<Stackable/>`.

*Return Value*

A string with the of classnames of all the ancestors of the given `<Stackable/>`,
up to, but not including, the `<body/>` element.


### Props

Name|Type|Default|Description
---|---|---|---
`target`|Element|`document.body`|Specifies portal target.
`descendants`|Function|`() => null`|Specifies a function to be called when the component mounts/updated. Receives the list of descendant DOM elements as an argument.
`children`|Node|`null`|Specifies the children of the component.

 > NOTE: Any prop other than the props listed above will be injected to the `div` element of the `<Stackable/>`.
