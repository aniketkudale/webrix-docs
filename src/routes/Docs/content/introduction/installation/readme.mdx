You can use Webrix as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrix), which you can install with `npm`
(or `yarn` if you prefer).

```bash
# With npm
npm i webrix

# With yarn
yarn add webrix
```

You can then import components/hooks like so:

```jsx
import {Movable} from 'webrix';

// For better tree shaking you can make your imports more specific.
// This can potentially reduce your final bundle size, but the
// difference can be negligible since the entire Webrix library
// is rather small
import Movable from 'webrix/Movable';
```
